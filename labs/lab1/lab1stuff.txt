Hello!

Please enter the following information.  First, change "Name" to "My name"
below.  Then provide your name and class year, which must be on the same lines
as "My name" and "Class year," respectively.  Then answer the question about
prior programming experience on a line following the question, leaving a blank
line between the question and your answer.  Finally, delete the "Something
interesting" block of text and replace it with your response.

If you are using Vim, the following keys in command mode might be helpful:

* 'i' puts you in insert mode, letting you insert text just before the
  cursor position.
* 'a' puts you in insert mode, letting you insert text just after the
  cursor position.
* 'o' creates a new line below the line where the cursor is and enters
  insert mode.
* 'x' deletes the character under the cursor.

My Name: Daniel Feldman
Class year: 2024

Do you have any prior programming experience?  If so, what?

As part of my work at a transportation analysis lab I work in, I learned a bit with R in RStudio in order to understand some of the fundamentals of dealing with data and later taught myself Python for data science and geographical data analysis. I have been working in Python for the past 4 months or so and have had some mentorship in it from some of my colleagues.

I grew up in Israel and lived there until the age of 16, when I moved to New York City.
